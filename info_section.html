<p>This section of the <strong>Calendar Data Manager</strong> enables you to update multiple events in your Google Calendar simultaneously, saving you time and effort. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filter Existing Events:</strong> Use fields such as <strong>Summary</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Color</strong>, and a <strong>Date Interval</strong> to select the events you want to edit. You can refine your search by combining these criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Apply New Values:</strong> Define the updates you want to make, such as changing the summary, description, or event color.</li>
<li><strong>Edit with Precision:</strong> Specify the date range and timezone to ensure that only the desired events within that period are modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've set your filters and new values, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to apply the changes instantly across all matching events. This tool ensures a seamless way to manage your calendar efficiently.</p>
