# Google Calendar Data Manager

## 📜 Description
This program, with a simple graphical interface, allows you to manage Google calendar events in a powerful way, specifically you can:
- **create events**;
- **edit multiple events** at once by filtering by multiple fields;
- **get a list of events** by filtering by multiple fields and save the results in a .csv/.tx file;
- **generate graphs** using the .csv/.tx file generated after getting the list of events, so you can get statistics for what you want.
